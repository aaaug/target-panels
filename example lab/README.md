# Example Lab
This is an example lab to demonstrate the best practice for sharing target panels from Alissa Interpret.

Each target panel requires its own folder and should contain at least four files:
- A file containing the details about the target panel, typically a README.md file.
- A BED file of the target panel exported from Alissa Interpret.
- A text file containing the gene list exported from Alissa Interpret.
- A text file contatining the regions exported from Alissa Interpret.
